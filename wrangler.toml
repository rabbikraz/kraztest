# Cloudflare Pages configuration for Next.js
# 
# IMPORTANT: The deploy command in Cloudflare Pages dashboard should be EMPTY
# Cloudflare Pages automatically deploys the build output from .next directory
#
# If deploy command is set to "npx wrangler deploy", it will now work
# But the BEST solution is to REMOVE the deploy command entirely
# Or change it to "npm run deploy" to use the proper Pages deployment
