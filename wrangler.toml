# Cloudflare Pages configuration for Next.js
# 
# NOTE: If deploy command is set to "npx wrangler deploy", this config makes it work
# But the BEST solution is to change it to "npx wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name=rabbi-kraz-shiurim"
# Or even better: Remove the deploy command entirely (Cloudflare auto-deploys)

# Assets configuration for wrangler deploy (Workers mode)
# This allows "npx wrangler deploy" to work by deploying static assets
